code to compute the role of a third network in the similarity between other two networks in a multiplex

This repository contains a set of scripts to assess whether in a multiplex of three networks *A,B,C*, *C* has a role in shaping the similarity between A and B (computed via the Jaccard similarity index), and to assess whether this role is of a *mediation* or *suppression* type.
The methodology and the results are reported in
